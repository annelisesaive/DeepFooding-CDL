# DeepFooding

## A software for automatic labeling of human eating behaviors

### Two main goals of the project

1 - Precisely and robustly track movements and actions using video-recordings of dining experiences using deep-learning algorithms (see: [DeepLabCut software package](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut))

2 - Create robust labeling of key eating behaviors based on resulting tracking spatial coordinates (e.g., mouthful, swallow etc.)

### To get you started

Here are ressources to help you [setup Git and Atom](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/resources/assets/atomgit/windows/) and to help you [manage Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) for the current project

You will also found [here](https://github.com/annelisesaive/DeepLabCut) the link to the DeepLabCut Github page where you will find all documentation, ressources and how to install the pacakge on your personal laptop
