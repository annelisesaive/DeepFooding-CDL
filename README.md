# DeepFooding

## A software for automatic labeling of human eating behaviors

### Two main goals of the project

1 - Precisely and robustly track movements and actions using video-recordings of dining experiences using deep-learning algorithms (see: [DeepLabCut software package](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut))

2 - Create robust labeling of key eating behaviors based on resulting tracking spatial coordinates (e.g., mouthful, swallow etc.)
